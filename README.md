# NFL CB Draft Prediction

This project uses Logistic Regression and MLP to predict 
draft round for cornerbacks based on NFL Combine drills and body 
measurements. This project is derived from my ongoing PhD
dissertation.

## Notebook Contents
- Exploratory analysis of NFL Combine and NFL Draft data
- Median Imputation by Draft Round
- K-Means and K-Prototypes Clustering
- LP and Logistic Regression models for predicting draft outcomes
- Draft Round Prediction Monte Carlo Simulator
- Dataset: NCAA cornerback Combine metrics, Draft outcome

## Packages
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras

## Repository Structure

- `NFL Combine Cornerback Data Analysis.ipynb` – main notebook
- `Cornerback Data_NCAA_2015_Combine.xlsx` – combined dataset

## Next Steps
- Add more predictors (e.g., # of NCAA seaons/games/snaps, NCAA PFF grades)
- Add more target variables (e.g., # of games/staerts/snaps with drafting team)
- Model outcomes using LSTM
- STAY TUNED FOR MORE DEVELOPMENTS!
